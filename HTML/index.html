    <p>rom Lamborghini and Ferrari to Roll-Royce, leading luxury carmakers have been witnessing unprecedented demand for their supercars as the world continues to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic.

Just like regular earners around the world, the richest cut back on consumption during 2020, with "double-digit" falls in sales for makers of the most coveted cars, said Felipe Munoz of market research firm Jato Dynamics.

But "customers for these cars were not as exposed as others" to the financial fallout of pandemic restrictions, he added.

For the wealthy, "their major problem was that they couldn't get out of their houses," Munoz said. "They postponed their purchases."

The rebound for exclusive cars was already underway in the final quarter of 2020 as they reached for their platinum credit cards again, cushioning the blow of pandemic restrictions by comparison to mass-market manufacturers.

Annual sales last year at Volkswagen-owned Lamborghini sped past their 2019 record to 7,430 vehicles, driven by the Italian manufacturer's hefty Urus SUV that clocks in at around 200,000 euros ($243,000).

Closed factories meant sales at Ferrari tumbled 10% last year, to 9,119.</p>
